Getting started with Autometrics and the Rust Axum web framework

This application showcases the [Autometrics-rs](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-rs) framework with Service Level Objectives and API handlers that are error or very slow.

It also sets the [build_info](https://docs.autometrics.dev/rust/adding-version-information) metric to track releases.
